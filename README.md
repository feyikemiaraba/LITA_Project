### Inference:
1. Overall Profit Trends:
   - There are two major brands bringing in the highest profit from 2017 to 2019 although there has been a drastic fall in the profit made per year. This may be due to reduction in product quality or increase in product price. 
   - The same pattern is noticeable across the remaining four product.
  
2. Brand Profit:
   - Beta Malt: Beta Malt had it highest profit in 2017 followed by a noticeable fall in subsequent years. This decline may be as a result poor marketing and sales alignment.
   - Budweiser: Budweiser had the second highest profit in 2017 after which there was a slit decrease in 2018. However, in 2019 there was a huge reduction in the profit made. Inflation in product price, ineffective marketing strategy may be some of the factors that contributed to decrease.
Budweiser still maintains it stand as in 2017.
